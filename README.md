# Simple-Library-Management-System
This C program facilitates the process of borrowing books from the VIT Library by allowing students to register their details before selecting a book. The program performs the following functions:

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Student Registration:

The program prompts students to enter their Name, PRN (unique ID), Department, and Division before borrowing a book.
Book Selection:

A predefined list of 100 books is displayed for students to choose from.
The student selects a book by entering its corresponding number.
If an invalid number is entered, the program asks for a valid input.
Book Location Mapping:

Once a book is selected, the program calculates and displays the row and column number where the book is located in the library.
Timestamp Logging:

The current date and time of borrowing are recorded using the time.h library.
Saving Student Data to a File:

All student details, along with the borrowed book information and timestamp, are stored in a file named student.txt.
User Interaction:

The student can choose to view their entered details before proceeding.
The program allows multiple students to register sequentially.
ðŸ”¹ File Handling:
The program uses fopen() to create and write student records to student.txt.
The details are stored in the file in a structured format for future reference.
ðŸ”¹ Error Handling:
Ensures that only valid book numbers (1-100) are accepted.
Clears input buffers to prevent unintended input errors.
This project can be extended by adding a book return system, student authentication, or integrating a database for enhanced functionality. ðŸš€
